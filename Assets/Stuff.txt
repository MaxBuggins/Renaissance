Guillory Castle FOUND, you wont beleavie its destination.

the Guillory Castle (initially wedged between the hills of stupide) that was last week seemingly lifted up and carried away across the very seas it faced. Has now been discovered in the гора mountains, all its inhabitants including the great Odilon and Elaine Guillory have been found frozen to death as the site is home to temperatures estimated at -30°. Only Idette Merle a major maid's body is still to be found by the time of writing.

Detectives have come across one set of tracks leaving the site, likely sea-gulls taking advantage of the opportunity.
