# Water_Flow_Shader
#StayatHome #YomequedoenCasa



	While everyone is stuck at home (including me) I've got created this simple project
where you can use it or combine with your projects, game workflows etc.

	I've used this shader before in my  lastests projects, ais very simple and light shader
very compatible with low generations mobiles platforms.

You will need is a quad, some textures and realese your creativity.

Try to experiment what color do in your texture, maybe you will find a perfect formula
of colors and achive an amazing river flowing effect or a black hole draining everything
around.

The project in this GIT was created in UNITY3D (2019.2.8f1) to show how the flow map is used
to recreate a awesome flowing water wiht some basics steps. 

The project content :

  째 Alpha CG unlit shader with basic Flow and Matcap
  
  째 LWRP HLSL unlit shader with basic Flow and Matcap
  
  째 Texture and Matcap used in the GIF example
  
  째 Materials with the example values
  
   
So, feel free to use the code, modify it, optimize it, break it, do whatever you want; I hope this 
could be usefull for anyone is trying to recreate a such amazing effect in this darkest time working
rom home. You can share with me what have you done, I will be very happy to see your works!
